# CPU-Usage
This is a simple program that monitors your cpu usage and displays an icon in the systray that represents the amount of cpu used. The green icon is displayed when cpu usage is below 30%. The orange icon displays when cpu usage is between 30-60% and anything above 60% displays the red icon.

This is ment to be expanded on by other people and all I ask is to not take out my name from it.
There are some issues that I still have that I hope someone else can fix because I have tried everything to do it and that is 
when you open the form and try to minimize it, it still shows at the bottom left corner. If you fix something please send me the new source code so I can upload it. Anyone who sends new and improved source code will be mentioned as a developer of the program.

 Somethings I want to add to the program:
 A mouse over that displays the % of CPU used in real time
 A better installer
 A way to get updates
